    The objective of this assignment/program was to strengthen my ability to create function and execute then along side sharpening my ability to create an HTML format and decorate my page with CSS. The most difficult part about this assignment was making everything pop up and hide when i needed them to. Something i will have to think about in the future is figuring out a better way to hide and unhide certain boxes on my screen because the way i did it here became very confusing and hard to read. Overall, i think this assignment was a success for the fact the everything for the most part is up and running smoothely. Some issues that remain was getting my scores to print out with the high score in first and so on. Another would be getting my name and score to print out separately so that I may create space between them, instead they are attached together in one string. One other was getting my submit button to disable after pressed so that you cant print your score more then once.
